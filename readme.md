# Pokemon Server API

Welcome to Pokemon Server API.
This project was created as a test to integrate with the Poke API.

The only api available currently is:
   "/pokemon/api/v1", which will return a total of 50 Pokemon.

This application was built using Flask and makes use of python's requests library
for pulling data via REST. For full details on the libraries used, please 
consult requirements.txt. This file can also be used via pip install on another
system.

The project can be started up using `flask --app pokemon run`
